# Analysis of Edmonton's Crime Statistics
### _A Data Visualization Project using Tableau_

Edmonton Crime statistics was analyzed for a **10 year period of 2009 to 2019**. For any data analytics or mining project, the first step is the business understanding. Data is one of the most important resource any business or industry can have, and when collected and interpreted correctly, can provide valuable insights to the business.

However, this can only start from understanding the business industry, be it domain of Health care, Retail, Finance, Engineering, Transportation just to mention a few. Without understanding the business or industry in question, it is almost impossible to have a data understanding, and if you can not make sense of your data, then you cannot ask your data questions.

### Edmonton Police Business Understanding 
Edmonton Police Services (EPS) classifies **Crimes and Disorder** into various categories. **Violent crimes** are made up of _Homicide, Sexual assault, Assault and Robbery_, while the **Property crime** category covers _Break & Enter, Theft of vehicle, Theft from vehicle and Theft over $5,000_.

EPS also tracks **Social Disorders, Domestic violence, and Impaired driving incidents.**

Other important indicators and **KPIs** worth tracking are **Crime Severity Index (CSI), Weighted Clearance Rate (WCR)**, Calls received by **emergency services**, and **Complaint**/Satisfaction Percentage. These Business concepts are defined in a data dictionary. A data dictionary is a part of the Data Understanding and should be a comprehensive definitions of the business and data terms.

### Data Preparation
The next step is the extract transform load. ETL is an interative process and can be carried out in Excel, PowerQuery, Visual Studio or/and Visualization tools like Tableau and PowerBI. In general, whatever transformations made to the data through cleaning, manipulation, wrangling, creating measures, calculated field just to mention a few , are all classified under the ETL process. 

For my analysis, I relied on Tableau for the transformation processes. 

### Data Modeling 
My visualizations has a summary that gives at a glance the important metrics. The summary page provides drill down to other dashboards with deep dive on violent crimes, property crimes,Â  social disorder, crime clearance rate and complaint Percentage.

## Evaluation
The visualizations gives valuable insights on Edmonton's crime indicators. **All KPIs showed a decrease for the year 2011 - 2014.** _This period of reduced crime activity should be further investigated to determine the underlying reason, and apply lessons learnt to improve current situation._ Questions such as did Edmonton see a decrease in population resulting in fewer crime count? was there an increase in police strength? was crime underreported during this period? All these and more is part of my recommendation for subsequent analysis.


## Conclusion
Analysis like these are useful in providing valuable insights to EPS to help in _resource allocation to the different neighborhoods, and to put preventive measures in place to make for a safer city._
